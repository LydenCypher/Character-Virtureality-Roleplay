The previous AI engineer began by attempting to fulfill the initial request for a ValoRoyal battle royale game. After confirming the codebase was a fresh start with only a  file, the AI engineer initiated a plan. However, the user abruptly changed the project's direction entirely to an AI character interaction app. The AI engineer successfully pivoted, acknowledging the new, complex vision. At this point, no code has been written for the new application. The engineer's last action was to confirm understanding of the new requirements and prepare to formulate a comprehensive plan for the updated project. The environment setup and architectural guidelines provided in the system prompt are critical for future development, despite no application code existing yet.

<product_requirements>
The project scope was significantly redefined during the initial interaction.

**Initial Request (Abandoned):**
The user initially requested ValoRoyal, a VALORANT-themed battle royale game. This application was envisioned as a creative mode similar to Fortnite, integrating all VALORANT maps into a single large map. A key feature was the ability to connect a Riot account to ValoRoyal to transfer skins from the base game. The problem to solve was creating a unique battle royale experience leveraging existing VALORANT assets and player progression.

**Current Product Requirements (AI Character Interaction App):**
The primary goal is to develop an AI character interaction application, combining features from existing platforms like Character AI, Minecraft Story Mode (Netflix interactive movies), and Otherhalf.ai.
Key features include:
*   **Core Interaction:** Users can interact with AI characters as if in a movie, with role-playing (RP) and role-playing game (RPG) elements.
*   **Communication:** Support for video chat, voice interaction (VR compatible with character voice answers), and text-based interaction.
*   **Feature Combination:** Incorporate all features of Character AI plus specific functionalities from Crushon.ai.
*   **Accessibility:** The app must be free to use and support multiple languages.
*   **Character Creation:** A comprehensive character creator tool.
*   **Multiplayer & Non-VR Experience:** Functionality similar to Discord for non-VR users, enabling multiplayer interactions.
*   **VR Compatibility:** Explicit support for Virtual Reality.

The problem this product aims to solve is providing a rich, interactive, and customizable AI character experience with social and immersive (VR) capabilities, free of charge.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture:** React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
- **Containerization:** Kubernetes environment.
- **Process Management:** Supervisor for backend (port 8001) and frontend (port 3000).
- **Environment Variables:**  for frontend API calls,  for backend.
- **API Routing:** All backend routes must be prefixed with .
- **Image Handling:** Base-64 format for frontend images;  for sourcing.
- **Testing:** , .
- **Integrations:**  for third-party services.
- **Error Handling:**  for complex issues.
- **Database IDs:** Use UUIDs, not MongoDB ObjectIDs.

<code_architecture>
**High-Level Architecture:**
The application is designed as a standard full-stack setup with a ReactJS frontend consuming APIs from a FastAPI backend, which in turn interacts with a MongoDB database. All services are intended to run within a Kubernetes container environment managed by Supervisor. Communication between frontend and backend uses environment variables and specific API route prefixes () to ensure proper ingress routing.

**Detailed Directory Structure (Expected, as per system prompt):**


**Files Examined/Modified (Current State):**
*   **/app/README.md:**
    *   **Summary:** This is the only application-specific file currently present. It serves as the project's root documentation.
    *   **Changes:** Initially contained . No further modifications were made during this trajectory.
*   **/app/test_result.md (Expected but Not Found):**
    *   **Summary:** This file is intended to store the original problem statement, testing data, and previous agent communication. It's crucial for context and workflow management.
    *   **Changes:** The AI engineer attempted to read this file, but it did not exist. No changes could be made as it was not found.

**Current Codebase State:** The codebase is minimal, consisting only of the  file. The core frontend and backend structures, along with their respective files, are not yet created or populated for either the initial ValoRoyal project or the newly requested AI character interaction app.

<pending_tasks>
- Formulate a comprehensive, detailed plan for building the new AI character interaction app. This includes outlining steps for implementing VR compatibility, video chat, character creation, multi-language support, and multiplayer features.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer's work centered on the initial project setup and understanding the existing codebase, which was found to be empty except for a  file. The engineer attempted to read  as per workflow instructions but found it missing. After listing the directory contents ( and ), the engineer confirmed a fresh start and was in the process of planning the ValoRoyal application.

However, the user then issued a complete pivot, requesting an entirely different application: an AI character interaction app with complex features like VR compatibility, video chat, character creation, multi-language support, and multiplayer capabilities.

At the precise moment this summary is requested, the previous AI engineer has acknowledged the drastic change in project scope. No code or architectural setup for the *new* AI character interaction application has been initiated. The only existing file is , which still contains . The current state is essentially a blank slate, with a new, challenging product vision requiring a fresh architectural and implementation plan.
