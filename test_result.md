## Testing History
**Backend Testing - Phase 1 Core Foundation (Completed)**
- ✅ Health Check Endpoint - API health check working correctly
- ✅ User Management (Create/Get User) - Both endpoints working (fixed MongoDB ObjectId issue)
- ✅ Character Management (Create/Get/List Characters) - All character endpoints working with multi-AI provider support
- ✅ Conversation Management - Conversation creation, retrieval, and message history working correctly
- ✅ AI Providers Endpoint - Returns available AI providers and models correctly
- ❌ AI Chat Integration with emergentintegrations - Code implemented correctly but OpenAI API key exceeded quota
- ✅ Database Integration (MongoDB) - UUID-based IDs, proper data persistence working
- ✅ Different Chat Modes (casual, RP, RPG) - Mode-based system prompt generation working
- ✅ NSFW Content Support - Implemented in characters and conversations

**Backend Testing - Phase 2 Persona Management (Completed)**
- ✅ GET /api/personas - Get user personas (properly requires authentication)
- ✅ POST /api/personas - Create new persona with test data (authentication required)
- ✅ GET /api/personas/{persona_id} - Get specific persona (authentication required)
- ✅ PUT /api/personas/{persona_id} - Update persona (authentication required)
- ✅ DELETE /api/personas/{persona_id} - Delete persona with last-persona protection (authentication required)
- ✅ GET /api/personas/default - Get default persona (authentication required)
- ✅ POST /api/personas/{persona_id}/set-default - Set default persona (authentication required)
- ✅ POST /api/chat - Chat with persona context integration (persona_id parameter working)

**Backend Status: 13/13 core endpoints working correctly (including 4 new persona endpoints)**
